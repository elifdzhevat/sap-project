# BringIt - Food Delivery Application

## Overview
BringIt is a Java-based client-server food delivery system, developed using **Java Swing** for the UI and **socket programming** for client-server communication.

The system supports three user roles:
- **Client**: Can register, log in, browse products, place orders, and view their orders.
- **Employee**: Can add/edit/delete restaurants and products, and generate reports.
- **Delivery**: Can accept deliveries and mark them as completed.

## Features

- Placing and viewing orders for clients.
- Accepting and completing deliveries for delivery guys.
- Viewing company turnover and delivery income reports (with bonus calculations).
- Filtering products by category.
- Refresh buttons for real-time updates.
- Full client-server communication over sockets using JSON.

## How to Run

2. Start the server:
   - Run `ServerMain.java` from the `server` package.
3. Start the client:
